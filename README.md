# Slider To Normalized
This class can be used to transfer 'normalizedValue` from a Slider component (source) to other Sliders (destination).
It can be used when you need to control multiple sliders with different tracks.

## Steps for use
1. Attach the **SliderToNormalized.cs** script to any **Slider** in the Scene.

2. **Sliders To:** Attach the sliders (destination) that will receive the value of 'normalizedValue'.
